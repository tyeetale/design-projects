# Design Projects

Sometimes, we find ourselves at an impasse between practicality and art. Especially as someone who wants to find balance in my designs, the only way forward is to keep honing my design skills with art projects, UI/UX research, and more practice. People first eat with their eyes before they actually eat their food. Likewise, design is the same way with how people interact with apps, and get impressions on a person's work.
Thus, I will continue to design to my heart's content. This repo is meant as a connection to my design work.

For the most updated public information, please consult my socials and design boards to see what I'm up to.
