# Learn Design Projects

As a budding entrepreneur, I want to ensure that I can be able to keep honing my design skills with art projects, UI/UX research, and everything visual. People first eat with their eyes before they actually eat their food. Likewise, design is the same way with how people interact with apps, and get impressions on a person's work.
